                <p>
                        For Karen Skinner suicide is the only option she has left. After enduring her husband's cheating, 
                        lying, and violence for seven long years he has finally pushed her over the edge by having sex with 
                        the fifteen-year-old girl next door—in Karen's own bed.<br><br>

                        In the early morning hours in her suburban Connecticut home Karen ends her suffering with a single 
                        bullet to the head... her husband's head. But Karen finds herself not just relieved to be rid of her 
                        abusive SOB of a husband, she is shocked that the cold-blooded act of her “wife-assisted suicide” has 
                        given her a thrill unlike anything she has ever known before. She suddenly understands what “blood lust” 
                        is.<br><br>

                        Thanks to Karen's meticulous planning and attention to the smallest details, the case is officially closed 
                        as a suicide. She has fooled all of the investigators ... except one. Tony LaCosta is sure that Karen murdered 
                        her husband—he just can't prove it.<br><br>

                        Six years later, Karen has remarried and has moved to the small coastal town of Logan's Point, Oregon—and she 
                        is feeling the urge to kill again.<br><br>

                        Karen is one of a group of six women who live around a cul-de-sac and share a closeness that transcends the 
                        friendship of just neighbors. When one by one her friends confide their marital woes to Karen she manages to 
                        convince them that they would be better off without their respective husbands, and that murdering them is not 
                        only much simpler, faster, and cheaper than divorce, but it is infinitely more satisfying. For Karen, however, 
                        the motivation to kill is always the same; the pure thrill of it.<br><br>

                        Through Karen's careful plotting and coaching, none of the deaths are even investigated as homicides. They are 
                        listed as natural, accidental, or suicide. Perfect crimes.<br><br>

                        But a chance meeting threatens to burst the wives' protective bubble of perfection when Karen runs into LaCosta 
                        at the Portland airport. Retired and in Oregon on unrelated business, he nevertheless finds the time to poke his 
                        nose into Karen's new life.<br><br>

                        Although his investigation is unofficial, he finds the deaths of so many neighborhood husbands highly suspicious, 
                        and his detective's instincts tell him that his prediction back in Connecticut, that Karen would eventually kill 
                        again, has come to pass.<br>

                        <p>This book confirms Ken Blaisdell as a master story teller. I was caught in its pages to the very end. It was as though I was there, but glad I never 
                            actually met any of the ladies in the story! If you like mysteries, you'll love this book.

                        <p>It is a feat when a writer creates memorable characters who live and breathe on the page and makes readers keep coming back for more. This is a 
                            very entertaining read, and I would highly recommend it to anyone.
