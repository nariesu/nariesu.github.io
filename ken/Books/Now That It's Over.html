                <p>
                    <span class="dropcap">That Wendy Cole Died</span> from a single gunshot to the chest was never in dispute. Whether it was a suicide or a murder 
                    staged to look like a suicide was the question.<br><br>

                    According to the aggressive county district attorney, James Pearlman, it was murder motivated by a half-million-dollar life insurance policy, 
                    and he managed to convince a jury that Wendy's husband, Joe, was guilty of the act.<br><br>
                    
                    There are many who don't agree with the verdict, however. Chief among them is the insurance company who would not have to pay Wendy's two kids 
                    the half-million-dollars if their mother took her own life. To that end, they hire former police detective Chelsea Monroe, now working as a private 
                    investigator, to see if she can put together enough evidence to convince a civil jury that Wendy died by her own hand.<br><br>
                    
                    Every person that Chelsea tracks down and interviews—family, friends, ex-husband, and extra-marital lovers—seems to have a different theory on how 
                    and why Wendy died. Few believe it was suicide, but fewer still think that Joe killed her.<br><br>
                    
                    In the end, Chelsea ends up with a jumble of puzzle pieces that she must somehow fit together to arrive at the truth. A truth that may not make 
                    her employer, the insurance company, very happy.

                        <p> [...] Ken describes his characters and events in great detail so it makes 
                            the visions in my head come to life. His stories are very believable and always keeps the reader wondering what's 
                            coming next. I'm hoping there will be more adventures for Chelsea and Kyle in the future.</p>
