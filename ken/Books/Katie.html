                    <h1>Katie: A Novel of Autism</h1>
                    <h2>Mystery // Thriller</h2>
                </div>

                <p>
                    <span class="dropcap">Katie Hale</span> should be the perfect scapegoat for murder. She is a 17-year-old girl with severe autism and a complete inability to communicate. But there is a lot 
                    more to Katie than most people think, and as her story evolves, we see her go from being the obvious villain, to an apparent victim, and eventually to an unlikely 
                    hero.<br><br>
                    
                    In the opening chapters it is obvious from her blood splattered clothes, hands, and face that Katie has had some kind of horrific mental breakdown, and has stabbed 
                    Sandy, her live-in au pair, to death. But the small town's deputy chief of police, a strong-willed, intelligent young woman named Marty Price, begins to detect flaws 
                    in the “obvious,” and goes from being Katie's arresting officer to being her staunchest advocate, trying to keep her out of a state mental institution by figuring 
                    out who really killed Sandy, and why. But is her allegiance misplaced?<br><br>

                    As Marty ties up the loose ends of her investigation to present a nice neat package to the DA showing that Katie could not have committed the murder, she uncovers 
                    several pieces of evidence—such as Katie's fingerprints on the murder weapon—that point directly back at Katie, and she realizes that her first homicide investigation 
                    is going to be a lot more complex than she at first imagined. Is Katie being elaborately set up by someone, or did she really do it?<br><br>

                    In the course of the investigation, Marty's all too common misunderstanding of severe autism being a form of mental retardation are corrected not only by Katie's 
                    mother, but also through Marty's personal and endearing interactions with Katie herself. An entirely different world opens up between the two when Marty discovers that 
                    Katie is able to converse by typing through a controversial process known as facilitated communication, and she comes to the humbling realization that not only is Katie 
                    not retarded, but that she is in fact an interesting, intelligent, and often clever young lady who just happens to be trapped in a cruelly malfunctioning body.

                        <p>I was drawn in from the very beginning and there was never a dull moment! Blaisdell obviously did his homework about the disorder and did a great job 
                            crafting Katie as a believable and lovable character who just happens to have autism. A lot of people will relate to and will be inspired by this book!

                        <p>I never thought I'd use the term "endearing" to describe a murder mystery, but that's a perfect word for both this book and its title character. Whether 
                            Katie committed the murder that is described in the opening of the book or not [...] you can't help but fall in love with her. Not only is this a great 
                            murder mystery, but the author does a wonderful job of dispelling many commonly held myths of autism at the same time. Highly recommend!
                        </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>This novel shows that a person does not need to be able to speak in order to share the intelligence and emotions of those of us who can, and that the 
                            condition known as "autism" is misunderstood by most of us. This story is thought-provoking and indeed a page-turner, not to be put down until the end. 
                            I am hopeful for a sequel to the Katie storyline!

                        <p>Ken Blaisdell's typical way of making his mysteries so believable shows forth again as the story of Katie unwinds to a surprising end that will likely 
                            linger in any reader's mind for a long time. I seldom read a novel twice, but I couldn't resist taking another walk through this one.
