                    <span class="dropcap"><i>Kiss for Luck!</i> is a story during war, but it is not about war.</span> It is five 
                    separate yet intertwined stories about the people whose lives are touched by a unique rifle.<br><br>

                    In May of 1944, the girls on a Chicago factory assembly line begin slipping a piece of paper with <i>A 
                    Kiss For Luck!</i> emblazoned on it into the rifles they are building. The practice is soon discovered 
                    and halted by the Army brass, however, and fewer than 500 weapons with the special talisman ever make 
                    it out the door. This book is a collection of stories connected by one of those rifles.<br><br>
                    
                    The story follows the lives, loves, and heartbreaks of the young women factory workers who labor through 
                    the night to support the war effort; the perilous adventures of the men and boys... and a Nazi saboteur... 
                    aboard the Liberty ship that ferries the load of rifles to England; an American Army Sergeant as he trains 
                    for D-Day and manages to fall in love with a British nurse; a gutsy and clever young woman fighting in the 
                    French Resistance; and lastly, years later, the progress of a former war correspondent who discovers the 
                    rifle with its lucky charm and traces the gun's history backwards from a farmhouse in France to his own 
                    hometown of Chicago.<br><br>
                    
                    A Kiss for Luck! is a captivating glimpse into many extraordinary lives connected by one special rifle.

                        <p>[...] This fictional account of the life of a particular M1 [carbine], from its factory to its retirement, is entertaining, funny, informative, 
                            and imaginative. The book contains five stories all tied to a particular chapter of this rifle, each with its own set of characters and caper. [...]

                        <p>[...] These characters are believable and the environments including descriptions of ships, vehicles, weapons and locations are accurate in every 
                            detail. The return trip the rifle makes to the USA and the involvement of the individuals touched during the journey is exciting and emotional. 
                            This book is a great WWII adventure.

                        <p>Outstanding book. I couldn't put this book down once I read the first page. I felt as though I knew the characters personally, every one of them 
                            real and worth getting to know. This book quickly moved to my favorites list and will become a book that I read over and over. It has something 
                            for everyone and can satisfy any reading mood you are in. Can't wait to read more from Ken.

                        <p>[...] Blaisdell immersed me in a generation of history that was previously something I just memorized to get through a high school class. This book has 
                            everything a reader could want - action, romance, drama, comic relief. Strong characters with very strong and admirable women that make you want 
                            to know them and be their friend. This book starts out good and just gets better and better; a must read!
