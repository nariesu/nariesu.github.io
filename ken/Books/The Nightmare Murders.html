                <p>
                    <span id="dropcap">Inspector Jackie Hall</span> might be living her worst nightmare as she plays a desperate game of cat 
                    and mouse with a twisted serial killer and a rage-filled father, each as cold blooded and dangerous as 
                    the other.
                    <br><br>Hall is the Acting Chief of Police in the quiet, rural town of Rowley, Massachusetts who is thrust into a 
                    high-profile murder investigation when a bizarre, seemingly-ritualistic killing is discovered in the woods of 
                    her sleepy little town.
                    <br><br>The killer, Jerome Carlton, is an addict. But his drug of choice isn't meth or cocaine, it's fear. 
                    The fear in the eyes of a young woman when she realizes she's about to die. Carlton has murdered fifteen times, 
                    and he is clever enough that the authorities have never even connected the deaths as serial killings.
                    <br><br>Benson McCray is the father of the Carlton's latest victim and is a retired CIA "interrogation specialist" 
                    who is now devoting his considerable resources, his unique skills, and an obsessive win-at-any-cost drive to 
                    finding his daughter's killer before the police can, so he may meter out his own special version of justice.

                            <p>[...] Dastardly villains, a dynamic heroine and plot twists and turns will leave the reader 
                                thinking twice before entering a wooded area after nightfall. 
                                Kudos to Ken Blaisdell for a finely spun yarn.

                            <p>Once I started to read The Nightmare Murders I couldn't put it down. 
                                Completely unpredictable plot that kept me interested and guessing until I turned the final page. 
                                Ken has a way of making his characters come to life. [...] Hoping for a sequel.

                            <p>You won't find a novel in the New York Best Seller List any better (or even as good) as Ken Blaisdell's 
                                Nightmare Murders. His attention to detail makes the story so believable you'll almost think you're 
                                reading a report about something that actually happened. Ken, we're waiting on a sequel.
