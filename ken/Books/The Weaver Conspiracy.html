                <p>
                    <span class="dropcap">"Shots fired! Shots Fired!"</span>

                        Those words, shouted by Secret Service agent Claire Bradley during an open-air speech 
                        by President Richard McClure, throw into motion a series of events that will take Bradley 
                        from the sight of the shooting, Newburyport, MA, to Boston, to Washington DC, to Israel, 
                        and back again as she doggedly follows a trail as thin, as intricate—and as dangerous—as 
                        a spider's web to find out who is behind the failed attempt to kill the president.<br><br>
                        
                        Bradley's valiant actions during the shooting are caught on tape, and she is catapulted 
                        into celebrity status. Eager to gain reelection votes any way that he can, the President 
                        presses the young and attractive hero into service as investigator and media spokesperson
                        for the executive task force he has created to probe the shooting.<br><br>
                        
                        But Bradley's strong will, her intelligence, and her fierce dedication to the truth meet 
                        their match as she finds herself spending as much time staving off Washington bureaucrats 
                        to keep the truth from being trampled as she does following real leads in the investigation. 
                        Leads that include Dave Price, a Newburyport cop who seemed to be in all the right places 
                        at the right times during the shooting; Frances Dunham, a maintenance worker in the building 
                        from which the shot was fired—who has mysteriously disappeared; a terrorist on a secret 
                        Israeli hit list; a mysterious ex-CIA operative, and an international arms dealer.<br><br>
                        
                        Enduring political manipulation, abuse by a sadistic Israeli commando, and even death threats, 
                        Bradley is eventually able to separate solid leads from dead-ends, misinformation, and 
                        disinformation to get to the truth … a truth that many around her don't want to hear, 
                        and a truth that even she is reluctant to believe.

                        <p>I thoroughly enjoyed the ending and appreciated the epilogue for letting me know what happened to the characters for whom I had become truly 
                            invested in. Absolutely the best book I have read in a long time.

                        <p>Blaisedell blends the techological style of Tom Clancy with the James Patternson-esque suspense
                            to deliver a fresh voice that captured me from page one.

                        <p>The author does not play by the rules when it comes to what you think you're going to read. This is not the average thrill ride you've read before.
                            [...] The style pulls you in and really gets you involved [...] I was happily surpised to find a new author I can look forward to reading more from.
